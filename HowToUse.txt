Firstly, run NxMLP.py:
Input: a table, represented as a list of lists (each list in the large list is a row)
    an epsilon is also required- the smallest amount of intersect needed between two cells from the same column
Output: a csv file called mosek_LP.csv
    the first line is a header, each subsequent line holds the data for one cell (error or normal)

You can see the output using Visualize.html, the red cells are the error cells

To reduce the error, use ErrorHeuristic.py
Input: mosek_LP.csv, epsilon, the number of rows and columns (including error columns)
    most importanly, the position of the error cell you want to try and reduce
    ex: if there is an error cell in the first row and sixth column, you would set it as (0, 5)
Output: an updated mosek_LP.csv
